## Feed Reader Testing
Welcome, this project was about testing with Javascript. I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and I used Jasmine to write tests for it.

### Getting started
To start, double click `index.html` or run open `index.html` from the command line. Scroll to the bottom of the page and you should see all tests completed by Jasmine.

### Dependencies
Base files provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)
